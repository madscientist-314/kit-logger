    <h3>What is the Duke Of Edinburgh (DofE)?</h3>
    <p>
      A life-changing experience. A fun time with friends. An opportunity to
      discover new interests and talents. A tool to develop essential skills for
      life and work. A recognised mark of achievement; respected by employers.
      <br />
      The DofE is many things to many people, supporting generations to
      successfully navigate adult life.
      <br />
      14-24 year-olds can do a DofE programme at one of three progressive levels
      which, when successfully completed, leads to a Bronze, Silver or Gold Duke
      of Edinburgh’s Award.<br />
      <br />
      There are four sections to complete at Bronze and Silver level and five at
      Gold. They involve helping the community/environment, becoming fitter,
      developing new skills, planning, training for and completing an expedition
      and, for Gold only, working with a team on a residential activity.
      <br />
      Any young person can do their DofE – regardless of ability, gender,
      background or location. Achieving an Award isn’t a competition or about
      being first. It’s all about setting personal challenges and pushing
      personal boundaries.
      <br />
      Through a DofE programme young people have fun, make friends, improve
      their self-esteem and build confidence. They gain essential skills and
      attributes for work and life such as resilience, problem-solving,
      team-working, communication and drive, enhancing CVs and uni and job
      applications. Top employers recognise the work-ready skills Award holders
      bring to their business.
      <br />
      The DofE licenses organisations that work with young people to run DofE
      programmes, such as schools, colleges, youth groups and clubs. Through the
      Licensed Organisation (LO) young people (or their parents / carers) pay
      for a Participation Place and are supported by Leaders who support them
      through their programmes, helping them to choose their activities, set
      their objectives and achieve their Award.
      <br />
      The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award is a registered charity, funded by
      donations, Participation Places and licences. The charity works with LOs
      across the UK to increase opportunities for young people to gain the
      benefits of doing their DofE.
    </p>
    <h3>Why do the DofE</h3>
    <p>
      For the hundreds of thousands of young people who take part each year, the
      benefits of achieving a DofE Award at any level are endless. DofE is about
      helping you along the path to a productive and prosperous future. As many
      of our participants say, it’s life-changing.
      <br />
      Achieving an Award will give you skills, confidence and an edge over
      others when you apply for college, university or a job. Beyond your
      academic achievements, universities want to see evidence of so called
      ‘soft skills’ that you have developed through extra-curricular activities,
      such as communication, commitment, leadership and teamwork. Your DofE
      Award is a fantastic way to demonstrate and evidence these skills in
      practice.
      <br />
      You’ll also make a difference to other people’s lives and your community,
      be fitter and healthier, make new friends and have memories to last you a
      lifetime.
      <br />
      Our participants also tell us that doing their DofE gives them character
      traits like confidence and resilience, that can boost their mental health
      and wellbeing and help them face and overcome personal challenges.
      <br />
      Watch our animations to hear the real stories of four Award holders –
      Lira, Lucy, George and Catherine – whose DofE gave them the space, focus
      and motivation to achieve things they never thought they would.
    </p>
    <h3>Where can I do the DofE</h3>
    <p>
      The DofE charity licenses thousands of organisations that work with young
      people, including schools, colleges and youth groups, to run the DofE
      across the UK.
      <br />
      If you’re interested in doing your DofE:
      <br />
      <br />
      – Ask your school, college or university – if they don’t already deliver
      DofE, they might consider setting it up.
      <br />
      – Join a national youth group that runs the DofE for its members, such as
      the Scouts or Girlguiding.
      <br />
      – Get in touch with your local youth club and see if it has a licence.
      <br />
      – If you’re over 18, do your Gold with DofE Direct.
      <br />
      Through a Licensed Organisation, you’ll be supported by a Leader who
      offers advice and encouragement throughout your whole DofE programme.
    </p>
    <h3>How old do I need to be</h3>
    <p>
      – Bronze – for those aged 14+ years
      <br />
      – Silver – for those aged 15+ years
      <br />
      – Gold – for those aged 16+ years
      <br />
      If you aren’t 14 yet but are in the school year in which your peer group
      turn fourteen, you may be able to start a Bronze DofE programme – check
      with your DofE Leader.
      <br />
      Similarly, if you aren’t 15 yet, but are in the school year in which your
      peer group turn fifteen, you may be able to start a Silver DofE programme
      – check with your DofE Leader.
