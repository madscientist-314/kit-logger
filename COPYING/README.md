# Kit Logger

A DofE Kit Management System

**A tracking and hire website for adventure Kit**  
Duke of Edinburgh (DofE) Kit Tracker and Loan application. This app should assist in keeping track of and maintaining the DofE kit  storage and loan system. This includes: QR codes, unique to each rucksack and tent, that can be scanned in and out; a login
system for students to hire kit under their name; a database to track where kit is and who has it; an admin access level for staff to maintain or update availability; and a tracker for how old kit is and when it needs to be replaced or maintained. This app’s    interface will be a website to allow for compatibility across devices and for easier maintenance and updates. This service should help transition from a complicated, messy collection of spreadsheets to one, easy and simple interface.
